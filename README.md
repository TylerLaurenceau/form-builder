Here is what I learned recreating this mock-up.


#jQuery
* How to use .ajax to pull JSON data from a link.
* Better understanding of when and how to use template literals.
* How to grab icons from fontawesome.com.
* Deeper understanding of using multiple functions to complete separate tasks.
* More practice on digging into array.
